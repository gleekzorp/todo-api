# Todo Application

This is my first attempt at doing a tdd/bdd approach to building a full stack application.

## Api Plan
- Create a todo application that has a flask-api backend connected to a sql-lite database during development and possibly postgres for production.


## Client Plan
- Two options of making the app a monolithic app and microservices
- First option will be building it all with flask, via render_templates, etc.
- Second option will be to make a react app to communicate with the flask api micro service

## Things I don't know
As you can see I don't know how to test flask apps or react applications.  I will try and take what I have learned from `Carlos Kidman`, `Matt Chiang`, `Mike Cataldo`, and all the other great speakers from `QA @ The Point`.
